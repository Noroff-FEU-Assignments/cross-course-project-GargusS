        <li>Use automatic backups</li>
        <li>Use Serverside validation</li>
        <li>Sanitize third-party HTML with modules in API</li>
        <li>Use ORM Tools. But consider this: ORM tools can be time-consuming to learn. They may not perform better when very complex queries are involved. However, ORM tools have several advantages. They speed up development time for teams, decrease the cost of development, handle the logic required to interact with databases, and improve security by eliminating the possibility of SQL injection attack.</li>
        <li>Secure the API key(s) in use, revoke exposed keys</li>
