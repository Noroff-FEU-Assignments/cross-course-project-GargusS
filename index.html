    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[<h4>Client side :</h4>
      1. (2FA) Use two factor authentication where this is supported, there are differents methods, and not all is equally secure, hardware security keys with physical touchpoint are the best option.
      2. **DONT** use the same password(s) everywhere, the preferred method for preventing others to make logins with your credencials is to protect them via a good passwordmanager.
      3. **Update** the software on your computer(s), this is probably one of the best and first tasks to consider doing a safe setup, either on the client side or the server side.
      4. Be careful with how much **information** you post online, especially on social media and other public domains without secure information input.
      <h4>Server side</h4>
      1. Install security plugins for CMSs like WordPress, or SiteLock type security add-ons for non-CMS sites.
      2. Use HTTPS using Kubernetes to automatically obtain the TLS certificates REQUIRED FOR HTTPS
      3. Keep **eveything updated
      4. Use automatic backups
      5. Serverside validation
      6. Sanitize third-party HTML
      7. Use **ORM**
      8. Secure **API** key, revoke exposed keys
      9. The CIA model, CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY, AVAILABILITY
